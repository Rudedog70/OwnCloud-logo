Here is a shell script to be executed with the Linux Message
of the Day. I designed a nice colored image of the OwnCloud
logo that anyone who uses SSH on their linux servers might
appreciate. It just needs to be appropriately named and placed
into the update-motd.d directory. Be sure the correct permissions
are set and the sshd_config file has been set to display MOTD.
