Here is a shell script to be executed with the Linux Message of the Day. I designed a nice colored image
of the OwnCloud logo that anyone who uses SSH on their Owncloud servers might appreciate. It just needs to be
appropriately named and placed into the directory where the scripts to compile the dynamic MOTD are located.
In Ubuntu 14.04 it's /etc/update-motd.d/. Be sure the correct permissions and ownership are set and the
sshd_config file has been set to display MOTD.
